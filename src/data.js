    info:
      "That’s the way we’ve always done it. Not really a sentence to inspire change. Except at Porsche. That’s because we’ve always made each new generation of engines higher-performing, more dynamic and more efficient than the last. The new engine generation of the Panamera models now takes the next significant step forwards.The all-new twin-turbo V6 engine in the Panamera 4S is lighter and more compact than its predecessor and comes equipped with VarioCam Plus. The two turbochargers are now positioned in between the cylinder banks. This reduces the distance that the exhaust stream has to travel to reach the respective turbo – delivering a more rapid response. The direct fuel injection in the new generation of engines is realised by a central injector inside the combustion chamber. This optimises both the mixture injection and combustion – for greater efficiency and increased power delivery.",

Such as that of a compact SUV that inextricably combines sportiness, design and everyday practicality: the new Macan. For us, aesthetics are not simply superficial.

    info:
      "The new Cayman is the sequel that continues the 718 era. At their heart, a four-cylinder turbocharged boxer engine beats with the same fighting spirit that delivered countless podium finishes. In them lives the will to break away from standards. And to inspire conviction. So it is entirely appropriate that they, too, should bear these three digits in their name and carry the 718 legend forward. The new 718 models were made for the sport of it. They are mid-engined roadsters that unite the sporting spirit of the legendary Porsche 718 with the sports car of tomorrow – and transfer it to the roads of today’s world. With one goal: to take the everyday out of every day.",

    company: "Porsche",
    info:
      "When Porsche unveiled the 918 Spyder concept at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show we were all in amazement. Within that amazement was a sense of a sense of pessimism, as we were unsure exactly how this future successor to the Carrera GT would look and run in the real world. We all know that manufacturers have a habit of “overestimating” its cars at these shows, to put it nicely. After more than three years, the 918 Spyder ended its testing phase and is ready for its world debut at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show. The 918 has made many passes around the “Green Hell,” thrashing its predecessor’s time in the process. All of these laps around the famed Nürburgring and at Porsche’s test facilities have given the automaker enough details to allow it to piece together all of its specs.",
